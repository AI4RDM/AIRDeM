            <h3>About AIRDeM</h3> 
<p>
RDM in the data intensive era has become increasingly challenging. Researchers face obstacles like manual (i.e. prone to error) and time-consuming (i.e. expensive) processes of creating metadata, removing inconsistencies in data formats, dealing with data heterogeneity and sharing for reusability. The lack of standardised and scalable tools supporting these tasks, leads to inefficient research data management.
</p>
AIRDeM explores how AI methods, particularly recent advancements in LLMs, can revolutionise RDM by enabling automation. The topics include, but not limited to:
 <ul>
<li>
<b>
Automated Metadata Extraction, Annotation, and Generation:</b> Leveraging LLMs and AI-driven methods to enrich metadata, enhancing the findability and accessibility of data across research domains</li>
<li>
<b>FAIR Metrics Enhancement:</b> Developing and applying metrics to measure and improve data discovery, interoperability, and overall data quality.</li>
<li>
<b>Enhanced Metadata Quality:</b> Utilising existing vocabularies, and KGs to enrich metadata, improve searchability, and enable data interoperability across heterogeneous datasets.</li>
<li>
<b>
AI-Driven Question Answering for RDM:</b> Incorporating AI-driven data descriptions, summarizations, and question answering chatbots to support researchers in searching, navigating and utilising the research data more effectively.</li>
<li>
<b>
AI-Driven Data Quality and Harmonization:</b> Use of AI tools for improving the data quality, dealing with missing, inconsistent data, and handling heterogenous multimodal data.</li>
</ul>
This workshop will showcase the application of state-of-the-art AI methods, including information extraction (IE) and neuro-symbolic AI, to support and enhance FAIR RDM practices. Additionally, it will explore how RDM practices can be significantly improved through the use of KGs and linked data, which play a crucial role in enriching metadata and standardization efforts. The workshop will also delve into the integration of LLMs with KGs, focusing on their tailored applications for streamlining and facilitating RDM tasks.
